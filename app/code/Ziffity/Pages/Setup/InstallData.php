It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"collect-use\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">what information we collect and how we use it</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example: We may ask for your personal information when you\'re discussing a service issue on the phone with an associate, participating in an online chat or purchasing a product.</p>\r\n<p>When you interact with CSN, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about previous CSN product purchases, such as their date of purchase; and information relating to a support or service issue.</p>\r\n<p>We collect information regarding customer activities on our websites. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet services are of most interest to them. We may use personal information to provide products that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve CSN\'s products.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"related\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">your csn id and related information</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">The CSN website allows you to create a \"CSN ID\" based on your personal information. This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services. Here\'s how it works: You create a personal profile - providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing address or a credit card number - and choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal CSN ID - in many cases simply your email address, because it\'s unique and easy to remember. The next time you order from the CSN website all you need to do is enter your CSN ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you. In addition, if you update the information associated with your CSN ID it will be available for all your transactions with Cable Shopping Network globally.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"public-infor\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">publicly displayed information is public</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">If you use a bulletin board or chat room on the CSN website you should be aware that any information you share may be visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit to one of these forums can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. CSN is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, CSN will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"disclose\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">when we disclose your information</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with legal entities within CSN who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with CSN\'s privacy policy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"vendors\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">with our service providers, vendors and strategic patners</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">There are also times when it may be advantageous for CSN to make certain personal information about you available to companies that CSN has a strategic relationship with or that perform work for CSN to provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with CSN\'s policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the CSN website. At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">How We Protect Your Personal Information CSN takes precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">The CSN Online Store-www.shopcsntv.com-uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the CSN Online Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it\'s transmitted over the Internet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"integrity\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">integrity of your personal information</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">CSN has safeguards in place to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the purposes for which it is used. And of course, you always have the right to access and correct the personal information you have provided. You can help us ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by checking here. You may request a copy of your personal information, your product registration history, and your interactions with our sales and support agents by contacting us at the email address below.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">CSN recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase our products for family use, including use by minors. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 for marketing purposes, but because some information is collected electronically, it can appear to be the personal information of the CSN purchaser of the product, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If an individual under 18 submits personal information to CSN and we learn that that personal information is the information of a person under 18, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"cookies\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">cookies and other technologies</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">As is standard practice on many websites, CSN\'s website uses \"cookies\" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that our online advertising is bringing customers to our products and services. We use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our customer communications. Cookies are used to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you with a greeting the next time you visit the CSN Online Store. If, however, you prefer not to enable cookies, please go to <span style=\"color: red;\">http://www.cookiecentral.com/faq/</span>which explains step by step how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the CSN website will not be available once cookies are disabled.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users\' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. CSN will not use the information collected to market directly to that person.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">In some of our email messages we use a \"click-through URL\" linked to content on the CSN website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">In addition, we use pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. They tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we\'re sending only messages that are of interest to our customers.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"companywide\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">our companywide commitment to your privacy</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">As we said, CSN takes protecting your privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate these guidelines to CSN employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"private-ques\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">privacy questions</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">If you have questions or concerns about CSN\'s Customer Privacy Policy or data processing,<br /> please use the email us at (customercare@shopcsntv.com).</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">CSN may update its privacy policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a significant way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"tab-2\" class=\"tab-pane fade in\">\r\n<div class=\"guarantee\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">30-day returns</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">We’re confident you will be satisfied with your purchase, but if not, you may return your item for a refund or exchange within 30 days of invoice date. Shipping and handling charges are non-refundable, and the product must be returned complete and in sell-able condition to qualify for a refund. Refund amount will include full purchase price and all collected taxes. Seals and cases contribute to the value of coin and currency collectibles and must remain intact and unbroken. This applies, but is not limited to: grading cases, Mint and Proof cases and packages, bag seals, original government sealed packaging, certificates of authenticity and/or any other special packaging or containers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">Customers are responsible for shipping charges and risk of loss on all return shipments. All returns must be shipped by a reputable shipper and be properly packaged and fully insured. Products returned after 30 days of shipping date are subject to a 20% restocking fee.</p>\r\n<p>Sorry but no returns are accepted after 60 days.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"tab-3\" class=\"tab-pane fade\">\r\n<div class=\"fq-privacy\">\r\n<h2 class=\"sub-title text-capitalize mt-20\">privacy</h2>\r\n<p class=\"mb-40\">You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.

You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your browser, or looking for \"https\" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>\r\n<p>While we use encryption to protect your information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

CSN doesn\'t benefit from the collection of sales/use tax and we remit collected tax directly to the taxing jurisdiction. We are required to collect tax on any order sent to States where we operate a retail business. There is no sales tax on orders delivered to most States.

The\r\n                                    system saves your information and assigns you a personal CSN ID - in many cases simply your email address, because it\'s unique and easy to remember. The next time you order from the CSN website all you need to do is\r\n                                    enter your CSN ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you.

This convenient service saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services. Here\'s how it works: You create a personal profile\r\n                                    - providing your name, phone number, email address, and in some cases your mailing address or a credit card number - and choose a password and password hint (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The\r\n                                    system saves your information and assigns you a personal CSN ID - in many cases simply your email address, because it\'s unique and easy to remember. The next time you order from the CSN website all you need to do is\r\n                                    enter your CSN ID and password; the system looks up the information it needs to assist you.
