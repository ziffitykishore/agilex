We recommend that you (the customer) are present at the delivery location to sign for and take possession of the shipment directly from the transportation company.

PLEASE NOTE: Timely deliveries of product hinges on UPS keeping to their posted shipping schedules. Rarely, but on occasion, deliveries are delayed due to "Acts of God”, such as poor weather. If an "Act of God" is blamed by the shipping company for a delayed delivery and you miss your required in hands date, we will allow you to refuse the order (for that reason only), and offer a refund for the cost of merchandise only. Shipping charges (both directions) will not be refunded. International delivery dates are never guaranteed so please allow enough time for transit.</p>

            <p>All orders are promptly processed. It is our goal to ship the orders within 5 business days of the order receipt Shipping is generally via UPS. All shipping charges including duties &amp; broker fees are the customer’s responsibility. Please allow adequate time for transit and customs clearance when ordering for a particular event. We recommend that you (the customer) are present at the delivery location to sign for and take possession of the shipment directly from the transportation company. We are not responsible for lost, stolen or pilfered canons left at unattended locations. If we have your e-mail address, tracking information will be sent the day your package leaves our warehouse. PLEASE NOTE: Timely deliveries of product hinges on UPS keeping to their posted shipping schedules. Rarely, but on occasion, deliveries are delayed due to "Acts of God”, such as poor weather. If an "Act of God" is blamed by the shipping company for a delayed delivery and you miss your required in hands date, we will allow you to refuse the order (for that reason only), and offer a refund for the cost of merchandise only. Shipping charges (both directions) will not be refunded. International delivery dates are never guaranteed so please allow enough time for transit.</p>
